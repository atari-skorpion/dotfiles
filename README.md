### dot files
Everything starts with configuring your development environment.

So dot files play a role when setting up your MAC or Linux system. As many before I'm creating my own dot files repository by analysing and adapting good solutions that already exists. My main reference is the dot files repository from [Paul Irish](https://github.com/paulirish). You will find the repository [here](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles).
