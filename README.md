### dot files
Everything start with configuring your development environment. So dot files play a role when setting up you MAC or Linux system. As many before I'm creating my own dot files repository by not by reinventing the wheel. Instead using good solutions that already exists. My reference the dot files repository from [Paul Irish](https://github.com/paulirish). You will find the repository [here](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles).
